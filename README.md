A dynamic blog system hosted on Github, you can see it here: https://bksingh2000.github.io/

I've created my own Blog API and hosted on Heroku Server from there i fetch the end points using jQuery and show all the blogs.
All the features are working (like Comment Box, Contact Us, New Blog).

My main motive is to host Dynamic website on Github which i successfully integrated.

For first time the loading speed will take some time as API is hosted on free Heroku Server
It dynos sleep after 30 minutes of inactivatity. But that doesn't matter at all.
